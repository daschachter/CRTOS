# CRTOS
Bare-metal operating system for the Cornell Rocketry Team (CRT). This code was developed for Microchip's SAMD21 microcontrollers. Scheduling is accomplished with protothreads. Includes UART and SPI communication drivers written from scratch. Includes library for interfacing with the SAMD21's on-board analog-to-digital converter.

(Note: The main repository for CRTOS is maintained on an internal BitBucket repository owned by CRT)
